                    My name is David Luu and I'm here for a new start in my professional career. For the past decade, I've worked in the field of education, 
                    initially as a teacher's aide, but ultimately transitioning into a general education teacher. The profession of being an instructor was always
                    fulfilling as I had the privilege to observe young minds develop and realize their potentials. I enjoyed knowing that I was able to play a role
                    in their lives, but moreso that I had the opportunity to act as a mentor and direct them to pathways that they never thought possible for themselves.
                    However, due to the recent pandemic, teachers are now pressured even more to work beyond the scope of their responsibilities. Educational budgets are 
                    reduced, but responsibilities are increased and expectations are higher now than before. As a result, I had to retire from this career for my own personal 
                    wellbeing. That's why I'm here today.</p>
                    <p>
                    I'm a full time father and my new drive to succeed derives from my devotion to my family's wellbeing. Technology is evergrowing and as a result, I wanted 
                    to be a part of that change. I still am nervous about these decisions and aware that there are various challenges and barriers to my success. However, I 
                    am determined to overcome these obstacles and become a front-end web developer.
