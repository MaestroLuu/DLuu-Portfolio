        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle"></p>

        <div class="about-me-body">
            <p>For the past decade, I've worked in the field of education, both in adminstration and 
                as a general education teacher. The profession of being an instructor was always
                fulfilling as I had the privilege to observe young minds develop and realize their potentials. I
                enjoyed knowing that I was able to play a role in their lives, but moreso that I had the opportunity to act 
                as a mentor and direct them to pathways that they never thought possible for themselves.
                However, due to the recent pandemic, teachers are now pressured even more to work beyond the
                scope of their responsibilities. Educational budgets are reduced, but responsibilities are increased 
                and expectations are higher now than before. As a result, I had to retire from this career for my own personal
                wellbeing. That's why I'm here today.</p>
                <br>
            <p>I'm a full time father and my new drive to succeed derives from my devotion to my family's
                wellbeing. Technology is evergrowing and as a result, I wanted
                to be a part of that change. I still am nervous about these decisions and aware that there are
                various challenges and barriers to my success. However, I
                am determined to overcome these obstacles and become a front-end web developer.</p>

        <h3>Career Objective</h3>
        <p>Front-end web developer utilizing prior educational background to develop 
            a more dynamic user experience on web applications. Currently earning a 
            certificate in full stack development from the UCSD Extension Coding program, 
            developing skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. 
            Passionate about resolving problems and driven to deliver code efficiency and 
            clarity during application development. With each project, my objective is to 
            engage my audience for an impactful user experience. I applied aspects of UX 
            and agile development in a recent project. I directed a team of four to develop 
            a single-page application that helped users locate COVID-19 testing facilities 
            within California cities. I am excited to apply my skills as part of a fast-paced, 
            quality-driven team to develop dynamic experiences for users on the web.</p>
