                    <p>
                        My name is David Luu and I'm here for a new start in my professional career. For the past
                        decade, I've worked in the field of education,
                        initially as a teacher's aide, but ultimately transitioning into a general education teacher.
                        The profession of being an instructor was always
                        fulfilling as I had the privilege to observe young minds develop and realize their potentials. I
                        enjoyed knowing that I was able to play a role
                        in their lives, but moreso that I had the opportunity to act as a mentor and direct them to
                        pathways that they never thought possible for themselves.
                        However, due to the recent pandemic, teachers are now pressured even more to work beyond the
                        scope of their responsibilities. Educational budgets are
                        reduced, but responsibilities are increased and expectations are higher now than before. As a
                        result, I had to retire from this career for my own personal
                        wellbeing. That's why I'm here today.</p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a full time father and my new drive to succeed derives from my devotion to my family's
                        wellbeing. Technology is evergrowing and as a result, I wanted
                        to be a part of that change. I still am nervous about these decisions and aware that there are
                        various challenges and barriers to my success. However, I
                        am determined to overcome these obstacles and become a front-end web developer.
