# DLuu-Portfolio

The web application is an outline of the projects that I have developed throughout my endeavors and illustrates my abilities utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various other coding languages. I utilized HTML and CSS for this portfolio to highlight the functionality of the web application and to direct users to other projects that incorporate other languages. Some challenges that I faced were understanding the functionality of CSS Flexbox and employment of semantic html alongside pseudo-elements. 

Additional features that I plan to implement in the future are forms so that other users can reach out to me in addition to using my contact information. 

Credit towards Chris Muto for his coding insight and recommendations on improving functionality of code references.
