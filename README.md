The web application is an outline of the projects that I have developed throughout my personal and professional endeavors and illustrates my abilities utilizing HTML and advanced CSS. My motivation for this webpage was to showcase the various projects I had completed that appropriately displays my skillset. I utilized HTML and CSS for this portfolio to highlight the functionality of the web application and to direct users to other future projects that will incorporate other languages. Some challenges that I overcame during the development of this web application were understanding the functionality of CSS Flexbox and employment of semantic html alongside pseudo-elements.
